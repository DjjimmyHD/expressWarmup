# Express WarmUp

### Purpose

Familiarize yourself with the express docs and the methods they use. In the server I built I have left comments giving you clues as where to look. After you feel comfortable-ish with the docs I have some `app.use` that will require you to use different express methods to achieve various results. If you finish everything, tear it down and build it again. 

**Pro Tip**

    - take the time to really understand what each piece of code is doing and pay extra close attention to where the data is, where it came from, and where it is going!

    - dont forget to npm install _after_ you fork and clone
